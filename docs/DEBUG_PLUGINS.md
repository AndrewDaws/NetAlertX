# Troubleshooting plugins

## High-level overview

If a Plugin supplies data to the main app it's done either vie a SQL query or via a script that updates the `last_result.log` file in the plugin log folder (`app/log/plugins/`).

For a more in-depth overview on how plugins work check the [Plugins development docs](https://github.com/jokob-sk/NetAlertX/blob/main/docs/PLUGINS.md).

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you read and followed the specific plugin setup instructions.
- Ensure you have [debug enabled (see More Logging)](./DEBUG_TIPS.md) 

### Potential issues

- Bugs
- Unexpected input (e.g. special characters in names)
- Dependencies changed how data is output

#### Incorrect input data

Input data from the plugin might cause mapping issues in specific edge cases. Look for a corresponding section in the `app.log` file, for example notice the first line of the execution run of the `PIHOLE` plugin below:

```

> The debug output between the ðŸ”»red arrowsðŸ”º is important for debugging (arrows added only to highlight the section on this page, they are not available in the actual debug log)

In the above output notice the section logging how many events are produced by the plugin:

```

17:31:05 [Plugins] Logged events from the plugin run    : 2
17:31:05 [Plugins] pluginEvents      count: 2

17:31:05 [Plugins] objects_to_insert count: 0
17:31:05 [Plugins] objects_to_update count: 4
```

These values, if formatted correctly, will also show up in the UI:

### Sharing application state

Sometimes specific log sections are needed to debug issues. The Devices and CurrentScan table data is sometimes needed to figure out what's wrong. 

1. Please set `LOG_LEVEL` to `trace` (Disable it once you have the info as this produces big log files).
2. Wait for the issue to occur.
3. Search for `================ DEVICES table content  ================` in your logs.
4. Search for `================ CurrentScan table content  ================` in your logs.
5. Open a new issue and post (redacted) output into the issue description (or send to the netalertx@gmail.com email if sensitive data present).
6. Please set `LOG_LEVEL` to `debug` or lower.
