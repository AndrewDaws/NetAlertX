## Installation Guides

The app can be installed different ways, with the best support of the docker-based deployments. This includes the Home Assistant and Unraid installation approaches. See details below. 

### Docker (Fully Supported)

NetAlertX is fully supported in Docker environments, allowing for easy setup and configuration. Follow the official guide to get started:

- [Docker Installation Guide](https://github.com/jokob-sk/NetAlertX/blob/main/dockerfiles/README.md)

This guide will take you through the process of setting up NetAlertX using Docker Compose or standalone Docker commands.

### Home Assistant (Fully Supported)

You can install NetAlertX also as a Home Assistant addon [![Home Assistant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repo-blue?logo=home-assistant&style=for-the-badge&color=0aa8d2&logoColor=fff&label=Add)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Falexbelgium%2Fhassio-addons) via the [alexbelgium/hassio-addons](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/) repository. This is only possible if you run a supervised instance of Home Assistant. If not, you can still run NetAlertX in a separate Docker container and follow this guide to configure MQTT.

- [[Installation] Home Assistant](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/tree/master/netalertx) 

### Unraid (Partial Support)

The Unraid template was created by the community, so it's only partially supported. Alternatively, here is [another version of the Unraid template](https://github.com/jokob-sk/NetAlertX-unraid). 

- [[Installation] Unraid App](https://unraid.net/community/apps) 

### Bare-Metal Installation (Experimental)

If you prefer to run NetAlertX on your own hardware, you can try the experimental bare-metal installation. Please note that this method is still under development, and are looking for maintainers to help improve it.
