# ⚡ Quick Start Guide

Get **NetAlertX** up and running in a few simple steps.

---

### 1. Configure Scanner Plugin(s)

> [!TIP]
> Enable additional plugins under **Settings → `LOADED_PLUGINS`**.
> Make sure to **save** your changes and **reload the page** to activate them.
> ![Loaded plugins settings](./img/PLUGINS/enable_plugin.gif)

**Initial configuration**: `ARPSCAN`, `INTRNT`

> [!NOTE]
> `ARPSCAN` and `INTRNT` scan the current network. You can complement them with other `🔍 dev scanner` plugins like `NMAPDEV`, or import devices using `📥 importer` plugins.
> See the [Subnet & VLAN Setup Guide](./SUBNETS.md) and [Remote Networks](./REMOTE_NETWORKS.md) for advanced configurations.

---

### 2. Choose a Publisher Plugin

**Initial configuration**: `SMTP`

> [!NOTE]
> Configure your SMTP settings or enable additional `▶️ publisher` plugins to send alerts.
> For more flexibility, try [📚 `_publisher_apprise`](/front/plugins/_publisher_apprise/), which supports over 80 notification services.

---

### 3. Set Up a Network Topology Diagram

**Initial configuration**: The app auto-selects a root node (MAC `internet`) and attempts to identify other network devices by vendor or name.

> [!NOTE]
> Visualize and manage your network using the [Network Guide](./NETWORK_TREE.md).
> Some plugins (e.g., `UNFIMP`) build the topology automatically, or you can use [Custom Workflows](./WORKFLOWS.md) to generate it based on your own rules.

---

### 4. Configure Notifications

> Notification settings support global, plugin-specific, and per-device rules.
> For fine-tuning, refer to the [Notification Guide](./NOTIFICATIONS.md).

### 5. Set Up Workflows

### 6. Backup Your Configuration
