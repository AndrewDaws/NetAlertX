# API endpoints

> [!NOTE] 
> Some of these endpoints will be deprecated soon. Please refere to the new [API](API.md) endpoints docs for details on the new API layer. 

NetAlertX comes with a couple of API endpoints. All requests need to be authorized (executed in a logged in browser session) or you have to pass the value of the `API_TOKEN` settings as authorization bearer, for example:

```graphql
curl 'http://host:GRAPHQL_PORT/graphql' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "query": "query GetDevices($options: PageQueryOptionsInput) { devices(options: $options) { devices { rowid devMac devName devOwner devType devVendor devLastConnection devStatus } count } }",
    "variables": {
      "options": {
        "page": 1,
        "limit": 10,
        "sort": [{ "field": "devName", "order": "asc" }],
        "search": "",
        "status": "connected"
      }
    }
  }'
```

## API Endpoint: GraphQL

- Endpoint URL: `php/server/query_graphql.php`
- Host: `same as front end (web ui)`
- Port: `20212` or as defined by the `GRAPHQL_PORT` setting

### Example Query to Fetch Devices

First, let's define the GraphQL query to fetch devices with pagination and sorting options.

```graphql
query GetDevices($options: PageQueryOptionsInput) {
  devices(options: $options) {
    devices {
      rowid
      devMac
      devName
      devOwner
      devType
      devVendor
      devLastConnection
      devStatus
    }
    count
  }
}
```

See also: [Debugging GraphQL issues](./DEBUG_GRAPHQL.md)

### `curl` Command

You can use the following `curl` command to execute the query. 

```sh
curl 'http://host:GRAPHQL_PORT/graphql'   -X POST   -H 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN'  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'   --data '{
    "query": "query GetDevices($options: PageQueryOptionsInput) { devices(options: $options) { devices { rowid devMac devName devOwner devType devVendor devLastConnection devStatus } count } }",
    "variables": {
      "options": {
        "page": 1,
        "limit": 10,
        "sort": [{ "field": "devName", "order": "asc" }],
        "search": "",
        "status": "connected"
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Explanation:

1. **GraphQL Query**:
   - The `query` parameter contains the GraphQL query as a string.
   - The `variables` parameter contains the input variables for the query.

2. **Query Variables**:
   - `page`: Specifies the page number of results to fetch.
   - `limit`: Specifies the number of results per page.
   - `sort`: Specifies the sorting options, with `field` being the field to sort by and `order` being the sort order (`asc` for ascending or `desc` for descending).
   - `search`: A search term to filter the devices.
   - `status`: The status filter to apply (valid values are `my_devices` (determined by the `UI_MY_DEVICES` setting), `connected`, `favorites`, `new`, `down`, `archived`, `offline`).

3. **`curl` Command**:
   - The `-X POST` option specifies that we are making a POST request.
   - The `-H "Content-Type: application/json"` option sets the content type of the request to JSON.
   - The `-d` option provides the request payload, which includes the GraphQL query and variables.

### Sample Response

The response will be in JSON format, similar to the following:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "devices": {
      "devices": [
        {
          "rowid": 1,
          "devMac": "00:11:22:33:44:55",
          "devName": "Device 1",
          "devOwner": "Owner 1",
          "devType": "Type 1",
          "devVendor": "Vendor 1",
          "devLastConnection": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
          "devStatus": "connected"
        },
        {
          "rowid": 2,
          "devMac": "66:77:88:99:AA:BB",
          "devName": "Device 2",
          "devOwner": "Owner 2",
          "devType": "Type 2",
          "devVendor": "Vendor 2",
          "devLastConnection": "2025-01-02T00:00:00Z",
          "devStatus": "connected"
        }
      ],
      "count": 2
    }
  }
}
```

## API Endpoint: JSON files 

This API endpoint retrieves static files, that are periodically updated. 

- Endpoint URL: `php/server/query_json.php?file=<file name>`
- Host: `same as front end (web ui)`
- Port: `20211` or as defined by the $PORT docker environment variable (same as the port for the web ui)

### When are the endpoints updated

The endpoints are updated when objects in the API endpoints are changed.

### Location of the endpoints

In the container, these files are located under the `/app/api/` folder. You can access them via the `/php/server/query_json.php?file=user_notifications.json` endpoint.

### Available endpoints

You can access the following files:

  | File name | Description | 
  |----------------------|----------------------| 
  | `notification_json_final.json` | The json version of the last notification (e.g. used for webhooks - [sample JSON](https://github.com/jokob-sk/NetAlertX/blob/main/front/report_templates/webhook_json_sample.json)). |
  | `table_devices.json` | All of the available Devices detected by the app. |  
  | `table_plugins_events.json` | The list of the unprocessed (pending) notification events (plugins_events DB table). |
  | `table_plugins_history.json` | The list of notification events history. |  
  | `table_plugins_objects.json` | The content of the plugins_objects table. Find more info on the [Plugin system here](https://github.com/jokob-sk/NetAlertX/tree/main/docs/PLUGINS.md)|
  | `language_strings.json` | The content of the language_strings table, which in turn is loaded from the plugins `config.json` definitions. |  
  | `table_custom_endpoint.json` | A custom endpoint generated by the SQL query specified by the `API_CUSTOM_SQL` setting. |
  | `table_settings.json` | The content of the settings table. |
  | `app_state.json` | Contains the current application state. |
  

### JSON Data format

The endpoints starting with the `table_` prefix contain most, if not all, data contained in the corresponding database table. The common format for those is:

```JSON
{
  "data": [
        {
          "db_column_name": "data",
          "db_column_name2": "data2"      
        }, 
        {
          "db_column_name": "data3",
          "db_column_name2": "data4" 
        }
    ]
}

```

Example JSON of the `table_devices.json` endpoint with two Devices (database rows):

```JSON
{
  "data": [
        {
          "devMac": "Internet",
          "devName": "Net - Huawei",
          "devType": "Router",
          "devVendor": null,
          "devGroup": "Always on",
          "devFirstConnection": "2021-01-01 00:00:00",
          "devLastConnection": "2021-01-28 22:22:11",

          "devPresentLastScan": 1,
          "devLastNotification": "2021-07-17 15:40:10.667717",
          "devIsNew": 0,
          "devParentMAC": "Internet",
          "devParentPort": 1,
          "devIcon": "shield-halved"
      }
    ]
}

```

## API Endpoint: Prometheus Exporter

* **Endpoint URL**: `/metrics`
* **Host**: (where NetAlertX exporter is running)
* **Port**: as configured in the `GRAPHQL_PORT` setting (`20212` by default)

...
```

### Metrics Explanation

#### 1. Aggregate Device Counts

Metric names prefixed with `netalertx_` provide aggregated counts by device status:

* `netalertx_connected_devices`: number of devices currently connected
* `netalertx_offline_devices`: devices currently offline
* `netalertx_down_devices`: down/unreachable devices
* `netalertx_new_devices`: devices recently detected
* `netalertx_archived_devices`: archived devices
* `netalertx_favorite_devices`: user-marked favorite devices
* `netalertx_my_devices`: devices associated with the current user context

These numeric values give a high-level overview of device distribution.

#### 2. Perâ€‘Device Status with Labels

Each individual device is represented by a `netalertx_device_status` metric, with descriptive labels:

* `device`: friendly name of the device
* `mac`: MAC address (or placeholder)
* `ip`: last recorded IP address
* `vendor`: manufacturer or "None" if unknown
* `first_connection`: timestamp when the device was first observed
* `last_connection`: most recent contact timestamp
* `dev_type`: device category or type
* `device_status`: current status (Online / Offline / Archived / Down / ...)

The metric value is always `1` (indicating presence or active state) and the combination of labels identifies the device.

---

### How to Query with `curl`

To fetch the metrics from the NetAlertX exporter:

```sh
curl 'http://<server_ip>:<GRAPHQL_PORT>/metrics' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>' \
  -H 'Accept: text/plain'
```

Replace:

* `<server_ip>`: IP or hostname of the NetAlertX server
* `<GRAPHQL_PORT>`: port specified in your `GRAPHQL_PORT` setting  (default: `20212`)
* `<API_TOKEN>` your Bearer token from the `API_TOKEN` setting

---

### Summary

* **Endpoint**: `/metrics` provides both summary counters and per-device status entries.
* **Aggregate metrics** help monitor overall device states.
* **Detailed metrics** expose each deviceâ€™s metadata via labels.
* **Use case**: feed into Prometheus for scraping, monitoring, alerting, or charting dashboard views.
