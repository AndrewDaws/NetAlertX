# Installation on a Synology NAS

There are different ways to install NetAlertX on a Synology, including SSH-ing into the machine and using the command line. For this guide, we will use the Project option in Container manager. 

## Create the folder structure

The folders you are creating below will contain the configuration and the database. Back them up regularly. 

1. Create a parent folder named `netalertx`
2. Create a `db` sub-folder

3. Create a `config` sub-folder

4. Note down the folders Locations:

5. Open **Container manager** -> **Project** and click **Create**.
6. Fill in the details:

- Project name: `netalertx`
- Path: `/app_storage/netalertx` (will differ from yours)
- Paste in the following template:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  netalertx:
    container_name: netalertx
    # use the below line if you want to test the latest dev image
    # image: "ghcr.io/jokob-sk/netalertx-dev:latest" 
    image: "ghcr.io/jokob-sk/netalertx:latest"      
    network_mode: "host"        
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - local/path/config:/app/config
      - local/path/db:/app/db      
      # (optional) useful for debugging if you have issues setting up the container
      - local/path/logs:/app/log
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Berlin      
      - PORT=20211
```

7. Replace the paths to your volume and comment out unnecessary line(s):

- This is only an example, your paths will differ.

```yaml
 volumes:
      - /volume1/app_storage/netalertx/config:/app/config
      - /volume1/app_storage/netalertx/db:/app/db      
      # (optional) useful for debugging if you have issues setting up the container
      # - local/path/logs:/app/log <- commented out with # âš 
```

8. (optional) Change the port number from `20211` to an unused port if this port is already used.
9. Build the project:

10. Navigate to `<Synology URL>:20211` (or your custom port).
11. Read the [Subnets](./SUBNETS.md) and [Plugins](/docs/PLUGINS.md) docs to complete your setup.
